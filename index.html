              <p>
                It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3
                lectures on the development of aeronautics and where the future
                lies in this exciting ‘space’.

              <p>
                Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as
                you sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your
                own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring
                the wonders of science.

              <p>
                On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the
                Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum.
                It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience
                the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
                powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
                able to use and control wind to create power.

            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
            to making science accessible to all.

            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them.
